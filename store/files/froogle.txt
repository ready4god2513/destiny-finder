http://localhost:8500/cfwebstorefb6/index.cfm?fuseaction=product.display&Product_ID=275	CDX-M800 CD Receiver	CDXM800	The CDX-M800 CD receiver upgrades Sony's Active Black Panel to an exciting full-motion fluorescent display with high-resolution graphics and screensavers! Open the faceplate, and the inner panel features a smaller LED display and soft-touch controls. Close the faceplate, and use the wireless remote to control the receiver when viewing the extra-large display. When you power down, the Active Black Panel does double-duty by disguising the receiver as a featureless panel in your dash. If your car has speakers low in the door, you'll appreciate the Dynamic Soundstage Organizer. It raises the stereo image off the floor, making your music sound more robust and exciting. No matter where your speakers are, Sony's 4-way high power will give them the juice they need to make your tunes come to life! Fine tune the sound with the seven preset curves and 7-band equalizer of EQ7. Add Sony's XM tuner and you're primed for the crystal-clear, diverse programming of XM Satellite Radio (antenna and subscription required). If you want even more entertainment, the CDX-M800 will also control a Sony 6- or 10-disc CD changer. Front, rear, and subwoofer preamp outputs simplify adding outboard amps to your system.
