<P><B CLASS="Heading">Getting Started</B></P>

<P>You'll want to start off by unzipping and copying the contents of the qForms
zip file to a directory either on your local PC or on a web server. The
<A HREF="./examples/index.htm">examples</A> included with qForms API do not
require a web server to run.</P>

<P>Once you've copied the files, go ahead and view a few of the
<A HREF="./examples/index.htm">example files</A>.
Play around with the forms and make sure to view the source code. I think you'll
be amazed by how little actual JavaScript was needed in order to get the forms
working.</P>

<P><A NAME="Installation"><B>Installation</B></A><br/>
Create a directory off the root of your web server to store the qForms API
files. For the purpose of documentation this directory will be called "/lib/".*</P>

<P>You'll need to copy the following files and directory into the "/lib/" folder.
The files are included in the "lib" sub-folder of the zip file.</P>

<UL>
	<LI>File: qforms.js
	<LI>Directory: /qforms/
	<LI>File: qforms_full.js (Optional**)
	<LI>File: qforms_init.js (Optional**)
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Note:</B> In a production environment, you may wish to use the versions
of the library files located in the "compressed" sub-folder of the qForms distribution file. 
The JavaScript files in this folder have all the erroneous white space and comments removed. 
This dramatically reduce the file size of the library&#151;which means faster download times 
for the users.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>* You can use this folder to store all of your JavaScript library
files in. If you already have a directory for this purpose, then you can install
the qForm files into that directory. Just make sure to substitute "/lib/" in
the documentation with the path where the qForms API files were installed to.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>** The purpose of these files is to simplify usage of qForms. If you
choose to use these files, you'll need to manually update the files with the
correct path to the qForm API files. If you install the files into the default
"/lib/" directory, then no changes are necessary.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="Preparing"><B>Preparing A Form</B></A><br/>
Before you can use the qForms API, there are few things you need to do. The first
thing you need to do is to load the qForms API library. You do this by loading
the qforms.js using the &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tag. Create a new HTML document, and place
the following in between the &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt; tags of your document:</P>

<PRE>&lt;!--// load the qForm JavaScript API //--&gt;
&lt;SCRIPT SRC="/lib/qforms.js"&gt;&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
&lt;!--// you do not need the code below if you plan on just
       using the core qForm API methods. //--&gt;
&lt;!--// [start] initialize all default extension libraries  //--&gt;
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt;
&lt;!--//
// specify the path where the "/qforms/" subfolder is located
qFormAPI.setLibraryPath("/lib/");
// loads all default libraries
qFormAPI.include("*");
//--&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
&lt;!--// [ end ] initialize all default extension libraries  //--&gt;</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The above code should be kept isolate from other calls to the qForm API. The
reason for this is the include() method acutally performs a document.write() statement
which outputs other &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags. These additional tags are not executed until
the end &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; tag is reached. If you receive errors that certain methods
are undefined which you know exist, try isolate the include() method in it's own
block of JavaScript code.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>NOTE:</B> The qFormAPI.setLibraryPath() and qFormAPI.include() lines are only required
if you wish to use the extension libraries-like the "Validation", "Field" and "Functions"
libraries. The usage of these functions will be explained in more detail later on
in the documentation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The next thing you need to do is to initialize a new qForms object. This must be
done after the form has been initialized by the document. This can be done
in two manors: creating a function to run when the document's onLoad event occurs,
or by placing the JavaScript code anywhere in the document after the ending
&lt;/FORM&gt; tag. For this demonstration, we'll initialize the qForms object
after the ending &lt;/FORM&gt; tag. Place the following code within the
&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt; tags of your document.</P>

<PRE>&lt;!--// a simple form //--&gt;
&lt;FORM ACTION="" METHOD="POST" NAME="<FONT COLOR="#CC3300">frmExample</FONT>"&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Enter some sample text:&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE="Text" NAME="SampleText"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
<PRE>&lt;INPUT TYPE="Button" NAME="Test" VALUE="Hello World!"
	onclick="objForm.SampleText.setValue('Hello World!');"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</PRE>
&lt;/FORM&gt;

&lt;!--// this code must execute after the end &lt;/FORM&gt; tag //--&gt;
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt;
&lt;!--//
// replace "frmExample" with value of the &lt;FORM&gt; tag's NAME
// attribute. you can also substitute "objForm" with any
// variable name that makes sense for you
objForm = new qForm("<FONT COLOR="#CC3300">frmExample</FONT>");
//--&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</PRE>

<P>Now save the document you just created and load it up in your browser.
Clicking the "Hello World!" button will place the text "Hello World!" into
the SampleText field. That's all there is too it!</P>

<P>Now that you have a basic overview of the qForms API, you're should be
more then ready to start using it in your projects. Take a look at the
<A HREF="./examples/index.htm">examples</A> for more inspiration.</P>
